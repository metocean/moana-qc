This module contains data quality-control scripts that are initially intended for the quality-control of oceanographic observation data.  Only automatic quality control is included at this time, for use with near real-time data.

For operational use, this library attemps to follow the standards described in https://github.com/metocean/msl_actions, where applicable. 

The first scripts are for the purpose of quality-controlling data from the Moana Project's Mangopare (Te Tiro Moana) temperature and pressure sensor, but will be made more generic when convenient.

More information will be included here as the library progresses.
