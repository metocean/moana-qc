<p>This dataset contains temperature and pressure data obtained for the Moana Project&#39;s Mang&omacr;pare Sensor
  Programme (<a
    href="https://www.moanaproject.org/temperature-sensors">https://www.moanaproject.org/temperature-sensors</a>), using
  Moana TD sensors (<a href="https://www.zebra-tech.co.nz/moana/">https://www.zebra-tech.co.nz/moana/</a>). Data are
  provided operationally, in near real-time, and this THREDDS directory is currently updated every two hours.</p>
<p>Only automatic quality control is included at this time, for use with measurements transmitted in near real-time. For
  more information on the sensor programme, see Jakoboski et. al, 2023, in preparation, contact <a

  or visit the websites above.</p>
<p>THREDDS subsetting is not yet available, but hopefully will be in the near future.</p>
<p>This the very first public release of these data, and as such, we expect to make improvements as we go. Please submit
  feedback to <a
    href="mailto:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#x40;&#109;&#111;&#x61;&#x6e;&#97;&#x70;&#114;&#x6f;&#x6a;&#x65;&#99;&#116;&#x2e;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#x40;&#109;&#111;&#x61;&#x6e;&#97;&#x70;&#114;&#x6f;&#x6a;&#x65;&#99;&#116;&#x2e;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>
  and we will incorporate any comments as soon as we can. We are also interested in any uses of the data, so please let
  us know and we will include it in our publications list on the Moana Project website.</p>

<p>Currently, data are available in netCDF format. If needed, additional formats can be added. Each file contains
  coordinates, variables, and ancillary variables. Filenames are of the format: MOANA_yyyymmdd_hhmmss_published.nc,
  which reflects the date and timestamp of the file offload from the sensor to the deck unit.</p>

<h2 id="quality-control-summary">Quality control summary</h2>
<p>&quot;Standard&quot; oceanographic QC tests for temperature and pressure data are applied. Most of these are based on
  QARTOD or Argo tests. A quality flag is assigned to each variable as an ancillary variable: </p>
<p>Quality flag values = [0,1,2,3,4]</p>
<ul>
  <li>QF = 0: QC not performed</li>
  <li>QF = 1: Test passed (good data)</li>
  <li>QF = 2: Test failed, but probably still good data</li>
  <li>QF = 3: Test failed, probably bad data</li>
  <li>QF = 4: Test failed, bad data
    Once all tests have been performed, a &quot;global&quot; quality flag is calculated (the &quot;worst&quot; value for
    all tests for each measurement), called &quot;QC_FLAG.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of QC tests to applied to a file are included under the <code>quality_control_log</code> attribute.</p>

<h2 id="position-information">Position Information</h2>
<p>Reported measurement positions are derived from the vessel position. Fishing methods (or any other deployment method)
  are dividing into two categories for processing: &quot;stationary&quot; or &quot;mobile.&quot; (Should be
  &quot;passive&quot; or &quot;towed&quot; in the future). Towed is simply gear towed behind a moving vessel. In this
  case, the sensor is always assumed to be in the same location as the vessel. Stationary gear is gear that is detached
  form the vessel (i.e. potting). All measurements in a stationary deployment are currently given the same position,
  which is the average between the first and last &quot;good&quot; location as recorded by the deck unit. If the first
  or last position is not near the surface, the stationary position cannot be calculated and processing will fail. </p>
<p>Please see the QC github repository (<a
    href="https://github.com/metocean/moana-qc">https://github.com/metocean/moana-qc</a>) for additional details on
  position processing.</p>

<p>Note that anyone who is part of the Mang&omacr;pare Sensor Programme can deploy a sensor. This includes a wide range
  of vessels, including fishing, industry, research, recreational, and citizen science vessels.</p>
